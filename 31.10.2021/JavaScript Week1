Practice Program:

Mark and john are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index which is calculated using the Formula BMI=Mass/heigent**2=Mass/ height *heights. mass in kg and Weight in Meter).
1.Store marks and John's mass and height in Variables.
2.calculate both their BoIS using the formula.
3. Create a boolean variable 'MarkHigerBMI' Containing information about whether mark was a higher BMP than John.

TEST Data 1: 
Marks Weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. 
John Weights 92 kg and is 1.95M tall.

Test data 2:
Marks Weights 95 kg and is 1.88m tall.
John Weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m fall
